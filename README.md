# Introduction

This project presents the analysis and implementation of a classification model. The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between two classes—Class 0 (non-target) and Class 1 (target)—in a dataset characterized by significant class imbalance.

**Objective:**

Develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict the target class with a strong emphasis on minimizing false negatives while maintaining reasonable overall model performance.


**Key Steps:**

1. Data Preprocessing and EDA:
Process of examining and summarizing a dataset to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions before applying machine learning models.

2. Model Development:
Evaluate multiple algorithms to identify the best-performing model, considering metrics tailored for imbalanced datasets.

3. Evaluation Metrics:
Assess model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and PR AUC to ensure the model meets project objectives.

4. Test Case Analysis:
Validate the model’s performance on samples that represents an out-of-distribution (OOD).
